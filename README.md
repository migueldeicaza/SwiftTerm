SwiftTerm
=========

SwiftTerm is a VT100/Xterm terminal emulator for Swift applications that can be embedded
into macOS or iOS applications.

This repository contains both a terminal emulator engine that is UI agnostic, as well as
front-ends for this engine for iOS using UIKit, and macOS using AppKit.   Additionally
there are a couple of minimal sample apps for Mac and iOS showing how to use the library.   

The companion module [SwiftTermApp](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftTermApp) builds 
an actual iOS app that uses this library and is more complete than the testing apps in
this module.

Check the [API Documentation](https://migueldeicaza.github.io/SwiftTerm/)

The macOS AppKit NSView implementation [`TerminalView`](https://migueldeicaza.github.io/SwiftTerm/Classes/TerminalView.html) is a reusable
NSView control that can be connected to any source by implementing the
[`TerminalViewDelegate`](https://migueldeicaza.github.io/SwiftTerm/Protocols/TerminalViewDelegate.html).  
I anticipate that a common scenario will be
to host a local Unix command, so I have included
[`LocalProcessTerminalView`](https://migueldeicaza.github.io/SwiftTerm/Classes/LocalProcessTerminalView.html)
 which is an implementation that connects
the `TerminalView` to a Unix pseudo-terminal and runs a command there.

There is an equivalent UIKit UIVIew implementation for
[`TerminalView`](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftTerm/blob/master/SwiftTerm/Sources/SwiftTerm/iOS/iOSTerminalView.swift)
which like its NSView companion is an embeddable and reusable view
that can be connected to your application by implementing the same
TerminalViewDelegate.  Unlike the NSView case running on a Mac, where
a common scenario will be to run local commands, given that iOS does
not offer access to processes, the most common scenario will be to
wire up this terminal to a remote host.  And the safest way of
connecting to a remote system is with SSH.

The core library currently does not provide a convenient way to connect to SSH, purely
to avoid the additional dependency.   But this git module references a module that pulls
a precompiled SSH client ([Frugghi's SwiftSH](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftSH)), along with 
a [`UIKitSsshTerminalView`](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftTerm/blob/master/iOS/UIKitSshTerminalView.swift)
in the iOS sample that that connects the `TerminalView` for iOS to an SSH connection.  

The iOS and UIKit code share a lot of the code, that code lives under the Apple directory.

Both of these rely on the terminal engine (implemented in class
`Terminal`).  The engine itself does not have a user interface, nor
does it take input, nor does it know how to connect to an actual
process, those are provided by higher levels.

In the longer term, I want to also add a tvOS UIView, a [SwiftGtk](https://github.com/rhx/SwiftGtk) 
front-end for Linux, as well as an implementation for my Swift console toolkit
[TermKit](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/TermKit).

This is a port of my original [XtermSharp](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/XtermSharp), which was
itself based on [xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org).  At this point, I consider SwiftTerm
to be a more advanced terminal emulator than both of those (modulo Selection/Accessibility) as
it handles UTF, Unicode and grapheme clusters better than those and has a more complete coverage of 
terminal emulation.   XtermSharp is generally attempting to keep up.

# SwiftTerm library

The SwiftTerm library itself contains the source code for both
the engine and the front-ends.  The front-ends are conditionally
compiled based on the target platform.

The engine is in this directory, while code for macOS lives under `Mac`, and
code for iOS, lives under `iOS`.    Given that those two share a lot of common 
traits, the shared code is under `Apple`.

Features
========

* Pretty decent terminal emulation, on or better than XtermSharp and xterm.js (and more comprehensive in many ways)
* Unicode rendering (including Emoji, and combining characters and emoji)
* Reusable and pluggable engine allows multiple user interfaces to be built on top of it.
* Selection engine (with macOS support in the view)
* Supports colors (ANSI, 256, TrueColor)
* Supports mouse events
* Supports terminal resizing operations (controlled by remote host, or locally)
* [Hyperlinks](https://gist.github.com/egmontkob/eb114294efbcd5adb1944c9f3cb5feda) in terminal output
* AppKit, UIKit front-ends
* Local process and SSH connection support (some assembly required for the last one)
* Proper CoreText rendering can munch through the hardened Unicode test suites.
* Seems pretty fast to me

Using SwiftTerm
===============

SwiftTerm uses the Swift Package Manager for its build, and you can
add the library to your project by using the url for this project or a
fork of it.

Working on SwiftTerm
====================

If you are using Xcode, there are two toplevel projects, one for Mac
and one for iOS in the TerminalApp directory, one called "iOSTerminal.xcodeproj"
and one called "MacTerminal.xcodeproj".  

This is needed because Xcode does not provide code completion for iOS if you 
have a Mac project in the project.   So I had to split them up.   Both 
projects reference the same SwiftTerm package.

When working with these projects, if you choose the terminal application
it will run this one.   To run the test suite, select the 'SwiftTerm' target
instead, and you can use 'SwiftTermFuzz' to run the fuzzer.

You can use `swift build` to build the package, and `swift test` to
run the test suite - but be warned that the test suite expects the
directory `esctest` to be checked out to run.  You can see how I run
these on GitHub actions in the file `.github/workflows/swift.yml` if you
want to do this locally.

If using Xcode, you can select the "SwiftTerm" project, and then use Command-U 
to run the test suite.

Test suites:
* [VTTest](https://invisible-island.net/vttest/) - old, but still good
* [EscTest](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/terminal-wg/esctest) - fantastic: George Nachman, the author of iTerm, created this test suite, and it became a FreeDesktop standard.  Since then, Thomas E. Dickey, the xterm maintainer and maintainer of many text apps has contributed to this effort.
