/**
 * This class provides the capabilities to launch a local Unix process, and connect it to a `Terminal`
 * class or subclass.
 *
 * The `MacLocalTerminalView` is an example of this, it is a subclass of the
 * `MacTerminalView` NSView, and it connects that view to the local system, providing a complete
 * terminal emulator connected to running local commands.
 *
 * When you create an instance of `LocalProcess`, you provide a delegate that is used to notify
 * your application when data is received from the lcoal process, to request the desired window size
 * that you would like to give to the child process, and when the process terminates.
 *
 * Once you create this instance, you can start a child process by calling the `startProcess` method
 * which will start the process.   You can then send data to this underlying process using the
 * `send(data:)` method, and you will receive the output on the provided delegate with the
 * `dataReceived(slice:)` method.
 *
 * Received data is dispatched via the queue that you provide in the LocalProcess constructor, if none
 * is provided, this will default to `DispatchQueue.main`.  Generally, this is a good default, but if you
 * have your own main loop or a different dispatching system, you will need to pass your own (for example,
 * the `HeadlessTerminal` implementation in the test suite does this.
